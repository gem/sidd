SIDD

What is SIDD?
------------

	SIDD is acronym of "Spatial Inventory Data Developer"  
	
	SIDD tool serves as a conduit between base data sets derived from both 
	ground observations and remotely sensed sources and a GEM compliant file. 
	
	Data is loaded into SIDD from the remote sensing module and the field data 
	collection tool and processed into a GEM suitable file. 
	
	Data from task 1 and/or task 2 are loaded into a local data repository 
	on the user’s hard drive. In addition, the user has the option of loading 
	land use data or delineations of “homogenous zones”.  Homogenous zones are 
	areas with sufficiently similar structure type distribution to be 
	characterized by a mapping scheme.  
	Once data is loaded into SIDD, mapping schemes are identified, created, or 
	constructed (Figure 1-1, task 3b). Mapping schemes are tools for the 
	statistical inference of structural parameters given data from a given area. 
	The development, application, and validation of mapping scheme results are 
	a primary function of the SIDD tool. Data may be based on regional defaults,
	expert opinion, survey data, or a combination of these factors. 
	
	After the mapping schemes are assembled, users apply the mapping scheme and 
	data preliminary exposure database is created. For the development of 
	inventories, the application of SIDD is likely to be an iterative process, 
	with users checking the results carefully and adjusting both geographic and
	statistical data to develop a final exposure data set that makes sense. 

DEPENDENCIES
------------

Quantum GIS 1.8 
	Internally, SIDD makes heavy use of Quantum GIS python library for GIS analysis

the following should be part of the Quantum GIS 1.8 installation
	- Python 2.7.x
	- PyQT 4.8.x
	- OSGeo GDAL/OGR '1.9.x'
	
INSTALLATION
------------
Windows
	- Edit enclosed setenv.bat 
	  Change LIB_HOME to root directory of Quantum GIS installation
	  The following are example installation directories
	    - as part of OSGeo packages
		SET LIB_HOME=C:\OSGeo4W
		- as Stand-alone installation
		SET LIB_HOME=C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS\	  

	- running tests
	  Use SIDD environment shortcut to start command window
	  type the following
		python run_tests.py 

START APPLICATION
------------
Windows
	- Use SIDD shortcut to start application
