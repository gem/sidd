def latlon_to_grid(lat, lon):
    """
    algorithm by Paul Henshaw 
    create a unique ID based on given lat/lon that conforms to the GED 30 arc-second grid
    
    A fixed size, evenly spaced 30-arc-second grid covering the world has 
        (360 * 60 * 2) x (180 * 6 * 20) = 43200 x 21600 
    cells. Since both 43200 and 21600 are less than 2^16, it is possible to use a 32bit 
    integer id (as with the current scheme) for all possible cells.

      id = (x << 16) | y
    Where:
        x = lon - half_cell * 60 * 2; 
        y = lat - half_cell * 60 * 2; 
        half_cell = half the size of a cell in degrees = 1/240 =~ 0.00416666666666667 
        i << j means a bitwise left shift i by the j bits 
        | means bitwise or (equivalent to +) 
    The "- half_cell operation" is intended to place the lat lon of a cell in the center 
    of the cell (as opposed to the corner)
